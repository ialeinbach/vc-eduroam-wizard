# vc-eduroam-wizard

The script `vc-eduroam-wizard.sh` assists with the process of connecting to Vassar's `eduroam` network.

The biggest limitation is its dependency on `nmcli`. If you're unsure whether or not you have `nmcli` installed, running the script will check for it automatically and tell you.

If you have any questions/suggestions/etc., please do reach out!
